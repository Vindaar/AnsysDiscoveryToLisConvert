* ANSYS Discovery Aim conversion tool

This is a simple tool, which converts files generated from ANSYS
Discovery Aim to so called LIS files (used by regular ANSYS afaik?
and) expected by [[https://garfieldpp.web.cern.ch/garfieldpp/][Garfield++]] to simulate particle interactions based on
models generated by ANSYS.

It should be as simple as handing the following files:
- FILL ME

And it will generate:
- ELIST.lis: mapping of nodes to elements
- NLIST.lis: mapping of nodes to coordinates
- MPLIST.lis: list of used materials
- PRNSOL.lis: simulation result mapping nodes to electric field

- ~*~: If used in an explicit dynamic analysis, the value corresponds
  to the percentage of damping in the high frequency domain. For
  example, 0.1 roughly corresponds to 10% damping in the high frequency domain.
- ~**~: (full and QRDAMP mode-superposition). Damping ratio in
  non-QRDAMP mode-superposition analysis. As a constant structural
  damping coefficient, it is also supported in transient analyses
  (full and QRDAMP mode-superposition) when an average excitation
  frequency is specified (DMPSFreq on TRNOPT). 
- ~***~: If you enter permittivity values less than 1 for SOLID5,
  PLANE13, or SOLID98, the program interprets the values as absolute 
  permittivity. Values input for PLANE223, SOLID226, or SOLID227 are
  always interpreted as relative permittivity.
