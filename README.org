* ANSYS Discovery Aim conversion tool

This is a simple tool, which converts files generated from ANSYS
Discovery Aim to so called LIS files (used by regular ANSYS afaik?
and) expected by [[https://garfieldpp.web.cern.ch/garfieldpp/][Garfield++]] to simulate particle interactions based on
models generated by ANSYS.

It should be as simple as handing the following files:
- FILL ME

And it will generate:
- ELIST.lis: mapping of nodes to elements
- NLIST.lis: mapping of nodes to coordinates
- MPLIST.lis: list of used materials
- PRNSOL.lis: simulation result mapping nodes to electric field
